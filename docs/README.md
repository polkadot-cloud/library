## Polkadot Cloud Library is No Longer Being Maintained

Dear users,

The Polkadot Cloud library is no longer being actively maintained.

Some of the Polkadot Cloud library components have been carried over to __`@w3ux/w3ux-library`__, that can be found at https://github.com/w3ux/w3ux-library. 

The Odometer, Polkicon, extension and validator assets, and connect providers, have all been carried over to [__`@w3ux`__](https://github.com/w3ux).

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.
